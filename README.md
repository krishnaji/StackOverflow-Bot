This Bot is intended to demonstrate a number of integrations between Microsoft Bot Framework, and Microsoft's Cognitive Services. From Microsoft's Cognitive Services, this bot uses: Bing Custom Search, Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS), QnA Maker, and Text Analytics. The full range of cognitive services that Microsoft offers can be viewed here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/.

Bot Framework allows you to build bots using a simple, but comprehensive API. The Bots you build can be configured to work for your users wherever they are, whether it's Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cortana, Slack or more.
